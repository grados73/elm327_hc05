## General info
Older cars that support CAN standard have a lot of knowledge about current car condition which don`t show us, but we can read them and display the ones that interest us.


## Screenshots
WILL BE ADDED

## Technologies
C,
Arduino IDE,
Bluetooth,
CAN.

## Code Examples
WILL BE ADDED

## Features
Display:
- Coolant Temperature,
- Battery Voltage,
- Input Air Temperature,
- Engine RPM,
- Car Speed,
- Engine Load,
- Fuel Tank Level,

## To-do list
Reduce the size, maybe I`ll transfer the design to STM.

## Status
The main aim of this project was reached, maybe I`ll back to transfer it on one PCB with STM32.
